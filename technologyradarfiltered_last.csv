Most countries do not have a baseline for the goals, as factors like corruption just don’t have strong indicator precedents. Tunisia is part of a group of pilot countries working to find ways to track and evaluate progress on SDG 16. Within this pioneering work, the Tunisia National Statistics Institute and the UNDP Tunisia office saw an opportunity for data innovation. Having completed the first household survey on governance and democracy, the team explored complementary data sources. Social media presented an exciting opportunity. While “corruption” may not be specifically quantifiable, public sentiment can be one indicator—and people are vocal on social media about their perceptions of corruption. The team researched whether public sentiment could be effectively measured by analyzing keywords in Twitter messages. By pulling tweets from the same time frame in which they had conducted the household survey, they were able to reach a clear correlation between the two data sources, indicating the value in further investigation.","artificial intelligence (machine learning; computer vision, nlp)",Prototype,TRUE

123,Using Big Data to understand the relationship between online extremism and offline violence,The group Moonshot CVE  utilises big data techniques to understand how extremism online might lead to violence offline. Their work has been used against ISIS as well as across the Unites States to counter the growing threat of far right extremism.,big data,Production,TRUE
131,Big data analytics to forecaset societal events ,"The Early Model-Based Event Recognition using Surrogates (EMBERS) system, incorporates the results of various separate predictive models in order to forecast events such as disease outbreaks and civil unrest events. It is a large-scale big-data analytics system for forecasting significant societal events, such as civil unrest incidents and disease outbreaks on the basis of continuous, automated analysis of large volumes of publicly available data. The project is a collaboration between the academic and business communities and is funded by the US Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA)’s Open Source Indicators Program. Among other things, inputs include RSS feeds from news websites and blogs, Twitter feeds, events pages on social networking sites and restaurant booking applications.",big data,Production,TRUE
132,Redirect Method,"The Redirect Method is an open source methodology developed by Jigsaw in partnership, with Moonshot CVE, athat leverages Google's AdWords platform and YouTube to target potential ISIS recruits and dissuade them from joining the group.",big data,Production,TRUE
135,Risk Model to Identify Domestic Violence Hot Spots in Mexico: Using Data to Shed Light on the Shadow Pandemic of Domestic Violence in Mexico,"The GIZ Data Lab, GIZ Mexico, and the Data-Pop Alliance have joined forces to address the dilemma of missing information, data gaps, and the need for data-driven solutions. As a result, the team is developing an experimental risk model to map geographical areas in Mexico where women could be at most risk of experiencing domestic violence by leveraging traditional (administrative) and non-traditional (e.g. mobility data) sources of data. ",geographical information systems (gis),Prototype,TRUE
136,"Macroscopic Traffic Flow Modelling, Road Speed Profiling, Traffic Congestion Nowcasting: Data for Sustainable Transport Systems","We were particularly interested in looking at the dynamics between regular days and special days (such as the Songkran Festival that takes place during the Thai New Year celebrations around mid-April). Therefore, analysing pseudonymised ride-hailing data covering the periods September-December 2018 and March-April 2019, we set out to find preliminary answers to the following questions:

How might ride-hailing data complement existing transport models, such as road speed profiling and traffic flow models?
To what extent can ride-hailing data provide real-time insights on traffic patterns?
Is there an opportunity to use ride-hailing data to shed light on possible exposure to air pollution?",big data,Prototype,TRUE
141,Response-automation system for legal advice,"BarefootLaw uses social media, websites and SMS to connect lawyers to individuals and small businesses seeking legal advice who are traditionally underserved. Machine learning is helping identify trends in legal needs (e.g. land conflict incidents increasing in specific areas or at particular times of year) and AI-enabled response-automation systems are being developed to provide quick answers to simple legal questions","artificial intelligence (machine learning; computer vision, nlp)",Production,TRUE
142,Earthquake early warning systems,"With support from USAID’s Development Innovation Ventures (DIV), the Mexico-based company Grillo developed a low-cost, open source earthquake early warning (EEW) system known as OpenEEW. Thanks to Grillo’s affordable system that enables schools and communities to install their own sensors, the children in Oaxaca can reach safety before the shaking reaches them.",big data,Prototype,TRUE
